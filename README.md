# Multimodal-House-Price-Prediction

# 🏡 Multimodal Housing Price Prediction

This project is a **Streamlit web application** that predicts **house prices** based on multiple features such as size, location, number of bedrooms, amenities, and furnishing status.  
The app is powered by a **Machine Learning regression model** trained on a housing dataset.
